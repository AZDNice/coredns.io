CoreDNS is a [DNS server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_server) that started its life as a fork of
the [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) web(!)server. It chains middleware, where each middleware
implements some DNS feature. CoreDNS should be a complete replacement (with *more* features) for
[SkyDNS](https://github.com/skynetservices/skydns).
